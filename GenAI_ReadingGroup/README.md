# GenAI Reading Group: Joint Energy-based Models (JEM)

This repository contains the code and resources for a reading group session on Joint Energy-based Models (JEM).

## Directory Structure

- `code/`: Contains the Python code for implementing and training JEM.
- `pdf/`: Contains the research paper and presentation slides.

## Code Components

The `code/` directory is structured as follows:

- `data.py`: This script handles the loading and preprocessing of the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `JEM.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive environment for experimenting with the JEM model, visualizing results, and demonstrating key concepts.
- `loss.py`: Defines the loss functions used for training the JEM model. This is crucial for optimizing the model's parameters.
- `models.py`: Contains the Python classes and functions that define the architecture of the Joint Energy-based Model.
- `sampling.py`: Implements methods for generating samples from the trained JEM model.
- `train.py`: The main script for training the JEM model. It orchestrates the data loading, model definition, and training loop.

## PDF Resources

The `pdf/` directory contains the following documents:

- `paper.pdf`: The original research paper on Joint Energy-based Models.
- `slides.pdf`: Presentation slides summarizing the key concepts and findings of the paper.
